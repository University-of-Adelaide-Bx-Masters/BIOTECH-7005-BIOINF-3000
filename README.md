Note that the Major Project topic accepotance and assignment only apply to Masters level students. Undergraduates do not do a Project. 

### Assessment Checklist

Have you:

- [ ] Answered all the questions?
- [ ] Followed naming conventions for Assessments?
- [ ] **Attached an assessment coversheet?** (Available [here](COVERSHEET.md)).
	- This is a course requirement. See the [Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/policies/230/). **Failure to attach a coversheet to your submission will incur a 5 point penalty for the assignment.** 
- [ ] Identified the work as yours?
	- Emails should have the course and assessment task names.
	- Documents should be named with your name, the course name and the assessment task.
	- Printed documents should have your name and the course and assessment task in the text/footer/header.
- [ ] Used appropriate electronic communication with assessors?
	- Emails should have a meaningful subject.
- [ ] Handed in the assignment before the due time (As specified on MyUni)?

### Major Project (20%) - Masters Students Only

In this course, next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets/protocols will used for the [Major Project](Assignments/major_project_2024.md).  *Note that these data sets have not been provided yet and that the major project assignment document has not been finalised yet*

#### Differential gen expression analysis (RNAseq)  

You will be assigned a unique dataset and carry out quality control (quality and sequencing adapter trimming), genome alignment, feature counting, normalising and removal of noise transcripts followed by differential gene expression analysis and downstream visualisation and statistical methods. For the major project, we will assign part of a published dataset and you will complete all the analysis tasks (from raw data to final results).
