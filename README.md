### Assessment Checklist

Have you:

- [ ] Answered all the questions?
- [ ] Followed naming conventions for Assessments?
- [ ] Attached an assessment coversheet? (Available [here](COVERSHEET.md)).
	- This is a course requirement. See the [Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/policies/230/).
- [ ] Identified the work as yours?
	- Emails should have the course and assessment task names.
	- Documents should be named with your name, the course name and the assessment task.
	- Printed documents should have you name and the course and assessment task in the text/footer/header.
- [ ] Used appropriate electronic communication with assessors?
	- Emails should have a meaningful subject.
- [ ] Handed in the assignment before the due time (Friday tutorial 9am)?

### Major Project (15%)

In this course, the following next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets/protocols are covered:

1. Whole genome sequencing/Resequencing
2. Transcriptome Sequencing (RNAseq)
3. DNA Methylation/Bisulfite Sequencing
4. Enrichment/Capture sequencing (Methyl-capture, ChIPseq, RIPseq)
5. Variant Calling

Each of these NGS approaches uses similar programs and analysis approaches, such as quality control (quality and sequencing adapter trimming), genome alignment, and downstream visualisation and statistical methods. For the major project, you will take a published dataset and complete all the analysis tasks (from raw data to final results) during the course.

You have the freedom to choose any dataset you would like before we start week 5's practical (Alignment practical), or choose from four datasets that we have chosen. You will be asked assessment questions on your data during practical assessments throughout the semester, and a final report will be due the week before the end of semester (Week 12)
