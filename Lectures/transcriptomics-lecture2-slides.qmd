# RNA-Seq

## RNA Sequencing

According to @Wang2009-hf

> RNA-Seq, also called RNA sequencing, is a particular technology-based sequencing technique which uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to
reveal the **presence** and **quantity** of RNA in a biological sample at a **given moment**, analyzing the continuously changing cellular transcriptome.


## RNA Sequencing

## The Key Steps

- Focus from here on will be sequencing mRNA using short reads

::: {.incremental}
1. Library Preparation
    + RNA Quality assessment
    + Selecting target molecules
    + Adding sequencing primers
2. Sequencing 
3. Aligmnent + Quantitation
4. DE Gene Detection
5. Downstream Analysis
6. (Optional) Nobel Prize

:::

<!-- ## Library Preparation -->

<!-- - RNA is a single-stranded molecule $\implies$ easily degraded -->
<!--     + Degraded RNA can skew expression levels during comparisons -->
<!-- - RNA Integrity Number (RIN) commonly used to identify low-quality samples -->
<!--     + Assesses 28S:18S rRNA ratio, along with overall size distribution -->

## RNA Selection

1. Select for poly-adenylated RNA using oligo-dT-based methods
    + Only extracts intact mRNA with a polyA tail (includes some ncRNA)

:::: {.columns}

::::

## RNA Selection  {.slide-only .unlisted}

2. Enzymatically deplete rRNA sequences 
    + rRNA targeted using probes $\implies$ dsRNA degraded
    + Can additionally target hbRNA (whole blood)

![Image from https://support.illumina.com.cn](transcriptomics/Ribo_Zero_1.jpg){fig-align="left"}

    


## Library Preparation


- RNA is then fragmented and size selected (200-300nt)
    + Very short transcripts always lost during this step
- cDNA produced
- Sequencing adapters added
    + Indexes are unique to each individual library $\implies$ always have replicates
    + Optionally contain Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI)<br>$\implies$ Helps identify PCR duplicates
- Most RNA-Seq now retains *strand-of-origin* information (Stranded RNA-Seq)
    + During PCR only the first cDNA template retained

# Alignment and Quantitation

## Genomic Alignment

- Alignment to a reference genome requires a *splice-aware* aligner
    + A GTF (Gene Transfer File) required when building the index<br>$\implies$ Provides all exon-transcript-gene co-ordinates
    + New Gencode, Ensembl etc releases at regular intervals
- Most common aligners are STAR [@Dobin2013-us] & hisat2 [@Kim2019-ib]
    + Return alignments as a `bam` file
- Aligned reads are then counted to provide gene-level counts
    + htseq [@htseq2014] and featureCounts [@Liao2014-gy] are very common
    + The same GTF should be used as during indexing

## Counting Alignments

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
![Image taken from https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/htseqcount.html](transcriptomics/count_modes.png)

:::
::: {.column}
- Some alignments align beautifully within exon structures
- Some overhang a little
    + Unspliced mRNA?
- Some genes are overlapping
    + Stranded libraries can resolve
- Maybe bacterial reads span genes within an operon

:::

::::

## Gene-Level Counts

- The region encoding a gene is (relatively) well defined
- An alignment within a gene is easy to assign to that gene

::: {.fragment}
- Much more difficult to identify which transcript it came from
    + Many transcripts share multiple exons
- Splice Junctions were the earliest approach

:::

## Gene-Level Counts {.slide-only .unlisted}

![Image taken from @Yu2015-f5](transcriptomics/gkv608fig1.jpeg)

## Transcriptome Alignment

- An alternative is to provide a *reference transcriptome*
    + Alignments no longer need to be splice aware
- Reads can (& commonly do) align to multiple transcripts
- Much faster than traditional alignment

::: {.fragment}

- Pseudo-alignment is used by kallisto [@Bray2016-qq] 
- Statistically modelled expression estimates used by salmon [@Patro2017-sn]
- Return *transcript-level counts* without bam files
- Add transcript-level counts $\implies$ gene-level counts

:::

## Pseudo-Counts

- Salmon counts are actually pseudo counts output by model fitting
    + Predicts the proportion of library derived from transcript
    + Fitted using EM-algorithm or Bayesian modelling

::: {.incremental}
- Counts bootstrapped to provide uncertainty estimates of prediction<br>$\implies$ *Measures how confident we are in the transcript-level counts*
- Transcript-level counts can be scaled by uncertainty estimate [@Baldoni2024-zf] when performing DTE analysis
:::

# Differential Gene Expression Analysis

## Differential Gene Expression Analysis

- A fundamental question:

**Does the overall abundance of a gene differ between experimental conditions?**

::: {.fragment}
- Need a statistical approach to answer this question
:::


## Count-Based Data

- Under both reference-types $\rightarrow$ counts represent expression
- These are *discrete* data (i.e. not continuous values)
- Microarrays were continuous values (fluorescence intensity)
    + Modelled using log~2~-transformed values $\implies \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$
    + Linear regression, $t$-tests etc
    + Mean and variance are independent variables
    
::: {.fragment}
- Count data is commonly modelled using a Poisson Distribution $\implies \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$
    + Poisson variance is defined as being equal to the mean i.e. $\sigma^2 = \mu$<br>$\implies$Mean and variance *are not independent variables*
    
:::

## Count-Based Data {.slide-only .unlisted}

- In most cases the observed variance is greater than the mean$\implies$ *over-dispersion*

::: {.fragment}
- We use the Negative Binomial distribution to model counts for gene $g$ in sample $i$

$$
y_{gi} \sim \text{NB}\left(\mu_{gi}, \sigma^2_g(\mu_{gi} +\phi\mu^2_{gi})\right), \text{where} \phi > 0
$$
:::
::: {.fragment}

- Can be thought of as like a Poisson with extra variation
- Extra variation is strictly defined in quadratic relationship to mean
    + Sometimes described as a combination of *technical* & *biological* variation

:::

## Count-Based Data {.slide-only .unlisted}

- Fit *generalised linear models* (GLMs) to model counts and estimate logFC
- Implemented in edgeR [@Chen2016-ig] and DESeq2 [@love2014-ds]
    + Slight differences in handling of over-dispersions
    + Both default to FDR-adjusted $p$-values
    
::: {.fragment}
- Same model for transcripts, but dividing counts by uncertainty estimate [@Baldoni2024-zf]
+ Can also model transcripts as proportions of gene-level estimates
:::

## Count-Based Data {.slide-only .unlisted}

- Poisson/NB-GLMs fit the rate of an event, i.e. counts per fixed measurement window
- Sequencing data produces 'libraries' of counts $\rightarrow$ total counts = *library size*
- In model fitting $\rightarrow$ estimate rate as a function of library size
    
::: {.fragment}
- TMM (edgeR) or RLE (DESeq2) approaches estimate scaling factors
    + Moderates the effect of highly expressed genes which dominate library size
    + In a perfect world $\implies$ all scaling factors = 1
- Library size when modelling is multiplied by scaling factors
    + The most effective normalisation methods for RNA-Seq
    
:::

## Count-Based Data {.slide-only .unlisted}

- A common alternative measure is *counts per million* (CPM) [or logCPM]{.fragment}
- CPM is simply counts divided by (library size / 1,000,000)
    + No longer discrete $\implies$ continuous data
- Relationship between mean and variance *still retained* for logCPM
    + Can't use naively in classic `limma`-based linear models

::: {.fragment}
- The limma-voom method [@Law2014-xq] uses weights to break the mean-variance relationship
    + Can then assume normally-distributed data <br>$\implies$ slightly more sophisticated and flexible models
- Alternatively, the `limma-trend` works effectively

# Beyond Differential Expression

## Transcript Assembly

::: {.notes}
StringTie is the quick & dirty method. Will also turn up some weird artefacts
:::

- With a good reference genome $\implies$ *StringTie* will identify novel transcripts
    + Very useful in some cancers

::: {.fragment}
- Can alternatively perform a full *reference-guided assembly* (Trinity)
    + Also works with more distantly-related references
    + Built a sea-snake venom-gland transcriptome using another snake genome
- Then predicted protein function from sequence homology
    
:::
